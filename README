This is a Lua implementation of Buttons, an XMPP-based remote control framework for hypertext TV.

It was designed with VLC (VideoLan Client) in mind, but should eventually be abstracted and useful elsewhere.

It won't run directly inside VLC yet, since the underlying Verse Lua XMPP library has some C-based 
dependencies that are not available within VLC's Lua.
