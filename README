This is a Lua implementation of Buttons, an XMPP-based remote control framework for hypertext TV.

It was designed with VLC (VideoLan Client) in mind, but should eventually be abstracted and useful elsewhere.

It won't run directly inside VLC yet, since the underlying Verse Lua XMPP library has some C-based 
dependencies (luasockets library ) that are not available within VLC's Lua.

Acknowledgements: see source code for numerous libs. Buttons was initiated within the NoTube EU project.

Google Talk: "it should just work", though you need LuaSec for TLS. This 
wraps OpenSSL so isn't pure Lua (and hence problematic in VLC). But installs
easily with 'luarocks install luasec'.


Squish:
lua -lluarocks.require /usr/local/bin/squish --use-http --internal-bit-module



Rough Notes ...

Lua XMPP Disco API: (from MattJ)

Firstly: conn:add_plugin("disco")
then: conn:add_disco_feature("http://someuri/")
Then when you send presence (I want to make a wrapper API for this...
conn:send(verse.presence():add_child(conn:caps()))
this adds the tag from XEP-0115
which is an optimisation really
